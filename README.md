# Correlation of Vaccine Hesitancy with COVID-19 Deaths and Cases

Vaccine hesitancy, which is the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines, has been proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the ten threats to global health in 2019 https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019, even before the global pandemic of COVID-19.

Vaccine is currently one of the most cost-effective ways of preventing disease outbreak and reducing disease consequence, and consequently diseaseâ€™s impact on economic. As of 2019, 2-3 million deaths a year are prevented by vaccination. If global coverage of vaccinations is improved , an estimated 1.5 million of death could be further avoided.

This report is to see if vaccine hesitancy actually impacts the death and case number of COVID-19 on a state level in the US.
